# Final-Project

Urban parking is a critical challenge in modern cities due to limited space and fluctuating demand. Traditional static pricing models often lead to inefficienciesâ€”either overcrowding during peak times or underutilization during off-peak periods. As cities grow and vehicle numbers increase, the need for smarter, more adaptive parking management becomes essential.

Dynamic pricing for parking is an innovative approach that adjusts parking fees in real time based on actual demand, occupancy, traffic conditions, special events, and other relevant factors. This strategy aims to:

Optimize the utilization of parking spaces.
Reduce congestion and the time drivers spend searching for parking.
Maximize revenue for parking operators while keeping prices fair for users.
Encourage more efficient use of urban infrastructure and reduce environmental impact.
In this project, we develop a data-driven dynamic pricing engine for 14 urban parking lots using real-time data streams. The system leverages features such as occupancy, queue length, traffic congestion, special day indicators, and vehicle type to set prices that reflect current demand. The goal is to create a robust, explainable, and real-time pricing model that benefits both operators and users, and can be extended to incorporate competitive pricing and rerouting logic in the future.

Motivation:

Improve parking availability and reduce time spent searching for spaces.
Balance supply and demand, especially during peak hours or special events.
Provide a fair and transparent pricing mechanism that adapts to real-world conditions.
Support city sustainability goals by reducing unnecessary driving and emissions.
This notebook documents the step-by-step development, implementation, and analysis of dynamic pricing models for urban parking, including data preprocessing, model design, simulation, and visualization.
